# Introduction


The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....



# Data {#sec-data}
## Methodology
The three datasets used by the paper were simulated, retrieved, cleaned, analyzed, and tested 
using the R programming language [@citeR], tidyverse [@citetidyverse], opendatatoronto [@citeopendatatoronto], knitr [@citeknitr], janitor [@citejanitor], dplyr [@citedplyr], ggplot2 [@citeggplot2], GeoJSON [@citegeojsonsf], and sf [@citesf].

## Data Source and Measurements
The data used for the analysis comes from the "cleaned_crime_data" and "cleaned_police_location" datasets. The datasets was constructed by calling the opendatatoronto package [@citeopendatatoronto], which accesses and download data from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal. The latest versions of the datasets was scraped on September 24, 2024 at 10:28 pm EDT. We also removed duplicate observations from the original dataset that comes from reading in GeoJSON files for the datasets. Other datasets we considered scraping includes the "Neighbourhoods" dataset to obtain neighbourhood boundaries for the maps but further testing showed that these boundaries were provided by the "cleaned_crime_data" dataset. 

### Neighbourhood Crime Rates Dataset
The "cleaned_crime_data" dataset was retrieved from the "Neighbourhood Crime Rates" dataset and the last time the dataset was updated on the Open Data Portal was on January 11, 2024. This dataset comprised of crime data by neighbourhood that included the number of cases of assault, robbery, homicide, shootings, auto theft, break and enter, and theft over. The original dataset was published by the Toronto Police Services collected from 2014 to 2023, inclusive and is updated annually. For the cleaned dataset, we decided to filter for homicides and shootings and focus on the cases from 2018 to 2023, inclusive. The 2023 population projection in the dataset was provided by Environics Analytics where they counted only the residents in the neighbourhood [@citeneighbourhoodcrimerates]. 

Each observation in the dataset represent one of Toronto's 158 neighbourhoods and its shootings and homicides from the years 2018 to 2023, inclusive that was recorded by the Toronto Police Services. There are 1896 unique observations in total in the dataset. 

Looking at @tbl-dataset-crime-preview, year represents the year the number of homicides and shootings takes place in the neighbourhood and num_of_cases and homicide_or_shooting were constructed based on the columns representing homicide and shootings in the original dataset. homicide_or_shooting indicates what the current crime in the neighbourhood the observation is describing and the num_of_cases indicates the number of cases for the crime indicated by homicide_or_shooting. hood_id is a number between 1 to 174 that represents the ID for the neighbourhood with some neighbourhoods having more than 1 ID. The neighbourhood column contains the name of the neighbourhood. 

Not shown in @tbl-dataset-crime-preview, the geometry column contains points to create the neighbourhood area the shooting or homicide takes place in and population_2023 represents the population projection for 2023 obtained from Environics Analytics. Other variables constructed from this dataset that is not shown includes num_cases_total, population_of_toronto, num_cases_total_per_neigh_per_crime, num_cases_total_per_neigh_per_crime_prop, num_cases_total_per_neigh, num_cases_total_per_neigh_prop, prop_of_toronto_pop_in_neigh, yearly_num_cases_total, and yearly_num_cases_total_prop. num_cases_total is the total number of shootings and homicides from 2018 to 2023 while population_of_toronto is the population of Toronto in 2023 obtained from summing up the population_2023 column. num_cases_total_per_neigh_per_crime represents the number of cases for either homicides or shootings in a particular neighbourhood while num_cases_total_per_neigh_per_crime_prop is the proportion of num_cases_total_per_neigh_per_crime in relation to num_cases_total. num_cases_total_per_neigh represents the number of cases total for each neighbourhood with num_cases_total_per_neigh_prop representing the proportion of num_cases_total_per_neigh in relation to num_cases_total. prop_of_toronto_pop_in_neigh is the population of the neighbourhood in relation to the population of Toronto in 2023. yearly_num_cases_total represents the total number of cases for each crime yearly across ALL neighbourhood per year and yearly_num_cases_total_prop is the proportion of yearly_num_cases_total in relation to num_cases_total.

### Police Facility Locations Dataset
The "cleaned_police_location" dataset was obtained from the "Police Facility Locations" dataset on the Open Data Portal. The last time the dataset was updated on January 20, 2023 and is updated as new locations are added. Each observation in the dataset represents a police facility in Toronto and its respective geographical point that is recorded by Toronto Police Services as new locations open. There are 26 unique observations in the dataset and contains two variables of interest facility and geometry. As seen in @tbl-dataset-police-preview, facility represents the name of the police location while geometry represents a geographical point of the location on a map.

```
## Variables of Interest
Our variables of interest from the "cleaned_crime_data" dataset are num_of_cases, homicide_or_shooting, hood_id, neighbourhood, and geometry. The variables constructed based on the dataset that are variables of interest includes num_cases_total, num_cases_total_per_neigh_per_crime, num_cases_total_per_neigh_per_crime_prop, num_cases_total_per_neigh, num_cases_total_per_neigh_prop, prop_of_toronto_pop_in_neigh, yearly_num_cases_total, and yearly_num_cases_total_prop. The variables of interest from the "cleaned_police_location" dataset includes facility and geometry.

## Police Facility Locations in relation to the Number of Homicides and Shootings from 2018 to 2023 across Toronto Neighbourhoods

@fig-homicides-map shows that there are a greater density of police locations closer to the downtown area of Toronto. We can see that neighbourhood 73 also known as Moss Park, which had the number of cases of homicides according to @tbl-highestcaseshomicidestable has a police location situated along its border. Mount Olive-Silverstone-Jamestown (neighbourhood 2) has a police station located in the neighbourhood. However with other neighbourhoods with a high number of homicides such as West Humber-Clairville (1), Avondale (153), Glenfield-Jane Heights (25), York University Heights (27), and Eglinton East (138) has no police facilities in their neighbourhoods.
